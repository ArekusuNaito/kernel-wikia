# Kernel

`Kernel` is the creator of the `Multiverse`. The one who is interacting with all data and is making reality be what it is. It is believed that Kernel is in an eternal slumber, while sleeping its processing everything in the Multiverse, it is unknown what will happen if this stops. He created the `Cosmos` and `Chaos` programs to help manage reality.

* How some stories image Kernel

Every Hero has spoken that they unlocked the ability to get their full potential after _an entity somehow touched their_ [_Entity Trinity_](https://github.com/ArekusuNaito/kernel-wikia/tree/81b3d6743505ee921d658ed53f83bd0e9327814f/entity-trinity/README.md). Later, The Heroes think that Cosmos was the one who unlocked their potential, yet Cosmos reveals she didn't do anything, rather she suggests it was Kernel who did this.

## The Multiverse

We live in a multiverse. Each Universe allocated in an immeasurable divine memory block. There were theories involving that this wasn't the case, that we lived in one immeasurable universe, yet this is not true, this is because each universe is a different instance with their own particular timeline with instances of the same beings but in different universes, this confirms that from Universe 0x1 every being is a different version of the beings at [Universe 0x0](https://github.com/ArekusuNaito/kernel-wikia/tree/81b3d6743505ee921d658ed53f83bd0e9327814f/universe-0x0/README.md).

* The One Who Sleeps
* Omni

## Trivia

* Together, Kernel, Cosmos and Chaos make the `Omni Trinity`.
* Some scholars believe that Kernel is not actually sleeping, that its just a way to say that Kernel is so busy _processing everything_ that exists, that doesn't want to intervene with the Multiverse and that's why relies on both Cosmos and Chaos.
