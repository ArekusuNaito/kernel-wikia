## Notes
- Theories of how each element interacts with the being.

    - Heart: Links feelings and the physical body
    - Mind: The conscience and how to execute knowledge to act.
    - Soul: An unseen and mysterious for those who do not know how reality is shaped. It is considered that your soul is all the data a living being has. The essence of a being comes encrypted here.
