# Delta Dragon

The Delta Dragon \(Δ Dragon, デルタドラゴン, Derutadoragon\) is the master of the Delta Dimension. The Dragon is Omnipotent, Omniscience and has the power of Omnivision **only** inside the Delta Dimension, if the Dragon is not there he's just a very powerful Dragon. The Delta Dragon serves both _The King_  and _The Queen_ as he refers to them like that.

## The Delta Dimension

The Delta Dimension is the realm of the Delta Dragon. It's _dynamic_, as it changes to the Dragon's will. The Dragon can make it incredibly small or as big as another multiverse. The Delta Dimension serves as a Middleware for others to change their location in a instant _even if the Challenger doesn't know doesn't know the exact location of their destination._

## How to enter the Delta Dimension

Across the Multiverse there are many Delta Gates. If someone wants to travel to another place, the Dragon must take them inside, usually the Dragon takes them by pulling them with one of his claws.

## The Challenge

The Dragon proposes a challenge to the visitor when they get there. If the visitor accepts the Challenge, the Dragon will turn off the visitor's aging. The Visitor cannot die due aging during the challenge and it will be trapped in the dimension until a result happens, either failure or success, but the visitor can die from other mediums during the Challenge.

If the challenge is completed, The Dragon will then proceed to ask something in exchange to use his power, this is, the winner has to pay a toll aside from completing the challenge . If the Challenger accepts the Dragon will take his toll and take them to their location immediately, going back to the normal course of the Multiverse as if the stance inside the Delta Dimension never happened.
