## The Shattering

After The Knight noticed a very unusual glitch activity, The Knight held a meeting with other heroes to discuss this situation. It was found that there was a very large and worrying glitch activity in a city called _Neo Palm City_, a city located in one of the universes completely dominated by darkness. Driven to protect life, he decided to travel to this city, sadly he was the only hero that could possible go to this place, thanks to his immunity against darkness itself \(that the Dark Knight provides\).

## The Dark Knight

The Dark Knight is the Knight's alter ego \(or alternate form\). While this was often believed that he only existed in his mind, The Dark Knight can warp Knight's current dimension and switch his place with him after his color dyes to black instead of crimson. This makes him an actual different being that is fully coupled with The Knight. An important point is that the two of them can't be together in the same physical space \(while it might be possible\) this has never been the case, it can be either one or the other knight, but not both.

### The Duality of Fire and Darkness

Although it might seem absurd, both Knights developed at some point a way to properly communicate information between them. Now, this doesn't mean that they will understand each other and fight for the same ideals, yet they can sync perfectly with each other when they have a common goal, e.g. protecting life no matter the cost. This is often seen when their loved ones are in danger and without thinking it twice they jump into the action to rescue them even if it this can take their lives.
