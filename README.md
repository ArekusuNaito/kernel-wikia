# README

Welcome to Kernel's Wiki! This is a knowledge database, the contents can change; such as the story, events, characters, skills, locations, etc. This is majorly a project of me exercising my writing skills \(Fantasy/Sci-Fi\) to create a story. The Kernelverse is vast and might be complicated to explain right from the get-go, you might wanna read [The Creation](https://github.com/ArekusuNaito/kernel-wikia/tree/18fbce36a081d3c81d4784f257cd3691e0033602/events/the-creation.md) first.

## Media Content notice

Images, Music and sounds belong to their correspondent owners. This media is not associated with the Kernelverse. I do not take credit from their images and they have all the rights about them, your creative work is highly appreciated, I understand how much work requires. I use them as a model, not as the final version of this creative exercise.
