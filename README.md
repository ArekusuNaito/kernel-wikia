# Welcome!

Welcome to Kernel's Wiki!
This is a knowledge database, the contents can change; such as the story, events, characters, skills, locations, etc.
This is majorly a project of me exercising my writing skills (Fantasy/Sci-Fi) to create a story.
The Kernelverse is vast and might be complicated to explain right from the get-go, you might wanna read [The Creation](/events/the-creation.md) first.



#### Media Content notice
Images, Music and sounds belong to their correspondent owners. This media is not associated with the Kernelverse.
I do not take credit from their images and they have all the rights about them, your creative work is highly appreciated, I understand how much work requires.
I use them as a model, not as the final version of this creative exercise.
