# Genesis



In the Beginning, _Time_ was not running and _Space_ was the smallest unit of storage, a _Bit_  with a value of 0. But then, it happened. `Time and Space were activated`. _Time_ started running and _Space_ started to expand. _For a brief period, nothing happened, only a void expanding as Time ran._ And then, an Entity appeared to command both Time and Space_._ That is _The Supreme One, we call this Entity:_ [_Kernel_](../../kernel.md)\_\_

_Kernel_ started communicating with _Time_ and _Space_, the two elementary properties of _Reality_. 

And _Kernel_ noticed that an Infinite and Eternal Emptyness running would be just a stateless reality. So Kernel started the design of a _Universe,_ a `Universe Class`. A `Universe` definition requires `Time` and `Space` and so, it happened. A `Universe` was born, the _First Universe_  was instantiated, and so, _Reality had a State._

The First Universe was static at the beggining, it was creating internal programs to handle and listen Time and Space's commands, but as Time passed the Universe began developing dynamic properties. And so in just a fraction of Time the Universe changed, the allocated Space for this _Universe_ started to _Overflow_, the First Universe began to expand, The First Universe was expanding itself.

Fascinated by this, Kernel decided to upgrade Time and Space so nothing like this would happen again, this properties of Reality were enhanced and they were ready to start something new.

As the First Universe kept expanding, Kernel decided to also upgrade the `Universe Class`. This Class would be more stable when being `static` or `dynamic`. And so _Kernel_ decided to create a new Universe, and with the newest upgrades of _Space and Time,_  they designed a container for every new creation. `Multiverse` was born, a container to hold everything in existence, _Time and Space would work together at all times, this union is called SpaceTime_, _The Divine Memory, The Divine Scheduler, it all happened in Real-Time, because it happened in our Reality._

With _Multiverse_ instantiated in the _Divine Memory_, _Kernel moved the First Universe_ to the first position avaliable for _Multiverse,_ and before creating the second one, Kernel started to design two new programs.

These two programs are very special creations, we like to think that these two were created by inspiration. It is believed that the behaviour of the _First Universe_ was what made Kernel to design them, to keep a balance between `static and dynamic` states. These two programs were named `Cosmos` and `Chaos` .

`Cosmos` would be in charge or _Order._

_`Chaos` would be in charge of Disorder._

_Kernel  extended a vast list of commands to them. These three form a Trinity, the OmniTrinity._

_And Kernel saw how Cosmos and Chaos, together, created the Second Universe._

> _We shall never touch the First Universe, as is the First Creation. Our priviligies cannot touch it.- They said_

For Eons, The Divine Memory kept expanding and adding new creations. _The First Universe_ was autonomous, it had meta-code, programs would create other programs. _Universe_ created other classes thanks to _SpaceTime_, new properties like `Gravity`, and a set of new entities called `Elementary Particles` appeared as well, extending the   `Divine Bit's`   functionality. `Elements` were born, eons later these programs would create the `Star` class and even the `Planet` class.

_The instance and process ratio was incredible, Multiverse would soon be holding almost a thousand of Universes, but with this results, Kernel decided to become the Pivot of Everything, The Core, everything has to be processed by Kernel, being in charge would guarantee that Multiverse could hold an Infinite Number of Universes for all Eternity. Cosmos and Chaos would be in charge of balancing the static and dynamic properties of everything, everything would be in Perfect balance with the Trinity working together._

> _It all seemed as if Kernel was ready for all of this, ready to command everything, starting with Time and Space. The Story goes that Kernel is "Sleeping", that is how everything can be processed without a single mistake. Everything just works..._

_But maybe, the real question is..._

_Who started all of this? Who decided to Power Up the Reality?_ 

> _What or Who turned on the Reality Console...?_
