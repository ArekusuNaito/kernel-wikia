_The Omnivision_ is one of the highest traits that an entity can have. It allows the user's eyes to see _anything_ they want in the present time. At its peak, this ability allows its user to see any moment in any timeline. For example, the user could try to see the very end of the timeline, or the very beginning with the proper authentication credentials.

## Wielders
- Kernel (Probably active all the time)
- Cosmos ( While able to, uses this power only when needed to see other heroes)
- Chaos ( Currently disabled)
- The Base Hero class: [a0a0be73](a0a0be73176ef1d370d602039ca3108b)

## A Special Hero Class
There's only one super class that acquires this power. Some believe that the original hero got this power from Cosmos, hence making the instances capable of using Omnivision.

- Pauline ( from Blue Belbet)
- The Detective
- Alice Palmer

### Special cases
There has been situations when other heroes used the power of Omnivision. None of these heroes inherit from that super class, yet they got it as a temporal gift from other heroes. [The Red Haired Prince](the-knight) received this gift in order to serve and protect others. Another special case is [Jannice](Jannice), while she doesn't inherit _Omnivision_ from `a0a0be73`, she actually is implementing it from that super class, so she's actually using Omnivision straight from it. Another myth talks about something called [The Jewel of Light](jewel-of-light), it is said that when channeling energy from it, it can give you the power of Omnivision.

## Trivia
- This is not by any means Omniscience, as the user will only retrieve knowledge from the seen things.
- The Knight used the Omnivision to see his loved ones during the events of [Knight: The Shattering](the-shattering).
- During the waltz in  [Revelations #921008](http://kernel-logs.tumblr.com/post/169802587960/revelaciones-921008), The Princess in this story manages to see the end of the Multiverse in that timeline. Cosmos disables her _Omnivision_ so she could enjoy her waltz. It is also revealed that the young boy's feelings went crazy when he saw her eyes using Omnivision, this must be such unique experience.
