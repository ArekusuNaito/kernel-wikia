An instance is an individual created from the original data of another Individual from  [Universe 0x0](universe-0x0).
Instances are special, as they are not a clone of an original, this is a brand new being, it was just created from a model or base individual. Each with their own [Entity Trinity](entity-trinity).

## Trivia

- Heroes can be instances too. (Many of the heroes are actually instances! ðŸ˜±)
- Weirdly enough, Heroes from [Universe 0x0](universe-0x0) are not actually instances. They are very special beings. This seems confusing, but that's how it is.
