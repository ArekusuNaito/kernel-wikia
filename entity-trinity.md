## Notes

* Theories of how each element interacts with the being.
  * Theory 1:
    * Heart: Links feelings and the physical body
    * Mind: The conscience and how to execute knowledge to act.
    * Soul: An unseen and mysterious for those who do not know how reality is shaped. It is considered that your soul is all the data a living being has. The essence of a being comes encrypted here.
