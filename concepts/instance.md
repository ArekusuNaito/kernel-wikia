# Instance

An instance is an individual created from the original data of another Individual from [Universe 0x0](https://github.com/ArekusuNaito/kernel-wikia/tree/81b3d6743505ee921d658ed53f83bd0e9327814f/universe-0x0/README.md). Instances are special, as they are not a clone of an original, this is a brand new being, it was just created from a model or base individual. Each with their own [Entity Trinity](https://github.com/ArekusuNaito/kernel-wikia/tree/81b3d6743505ee921d658ed53f83bd0e9327814f/entity-trinity/README.md).

## Trivia

* Heroes can be instances too. \(Many of the heroes are actually instances! ðŸ˜±\)
* Weirdly enough, Heroes from [Universe 0x0](https://github.com/ArekusuNaito/kernel-wikia/tree/81b3d6743505ee921d658ed53f83bd0e9327814f/universe-0x0/README.md) are not actually instances. They are very special beings. This seems confusing, but that's how it is.
