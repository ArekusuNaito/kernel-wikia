A `Hero` is an individual with a very strong [Entity Trinity](entity-trinity). These individuals were called to prevent the destruction of reality, where all matter, all data would banished forever and never be executed again. The only task Kernel had was to [call](ping) every hero and fill their trinity to know the truth about the Multiverse.




## The Genesis of Heroes

In the log [For you...](http://kernel-logs.tumblr.com/post/169764553605/por-ustedes) its explained that every hero is born from a super class taken from the original data of an entity created  in what it's believed to be [Universe 0x0](universe-0x0).  Heroes take all the information from the original entity and implement it in their own way, making them very unique. The log mentions there's a memory block assigned for all the instances of a hero class, in other words, the same memory block contains data of that hero from different universes. This implies that the majority of  Heroes are [Instances](instance) from mentioned super class.
